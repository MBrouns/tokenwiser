> Bag of, not just words, but tricks!

This project contains a couple of scikit-learn/vowpal wabbit/spacy compatible "tricks" that I've used in
NLP experiments. It's meant as a celebration of tricks using sparse techniques.

## SubModules

1. `.prep`: Contains string pre-processing tools for scikit-learn. Meant as a preprocessing step before a countvectorizer.
